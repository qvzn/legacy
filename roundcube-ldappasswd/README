Roundcube password module utilizing ldappasswd(1)

 * Password change driver using the OpenLDAP ldappasswd(1) utility
 *
 * Advantages of this method:
 *  - No extra configuration if OpenLDAP/ldappasswd are already configured
 *  - Indifferent to password storage (attribute) and hashing details
 *  - Future-proof: supports everything ldappasswd(1) can do now, and later
 *  - TLS/SSF verification is done by OpenLDAP according to system settings
 *  - Uses PASSMOD extended operation; no need to retrieve full user record
 *
 * Disadvantages:
 *  - ldappasswd(1) must be installed and configured on the local system
 *

 ***          This implementation REQUIRES /dev/fd/N for N>2            ***
 ***         On BSD variants you may need to mount fdescfs(4)           ***
 **************************************************************************
 *
 * Unlike, e.g., GnuPG, ldappasswd(1) does not support passing a numeric fd
 * from which to read a password. Since writing the password to a temporary
 * file or passing on the command line is unacceptable, /dev/fd is the only
 * secure method if we want a non-interactive option
